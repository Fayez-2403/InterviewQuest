"You are playing a simplified PAC-MAN game on an infinite 2-D grid. You start at the point [0, 0], and you are given a destination point target = [xtarget, ytarget] that you are trying to get to. There are several ghosts on the map with their starting positions given as a 2D array ghosts, where ghosts[i] = [xi, yi] represents the starting position of the ith ghost. All inputs are integral coordinates. Each turn, you and all the ghosts may independently choose to either move 1 unit in any of the four cardinal directions: north, east, south, or west, or stay still. All actions happen simultaneously. You escape if and only if you can reach the target before any ghost reaches you. If you reach any square (including the target) at the same time as a ghost, it does not count as an escape.

An uncommon subsequence between two strings is a string that is a subsequence of one but not the other. A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.

"In the video game Fallout 4, the quest ""Road to Freedom"" requires players to reach a metal dial called the ""Freedom Trail Ring"" and use the dial to spell a specific keyword to open the door. Given a string ring that represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string key that represents the keyword that needs to be spelled, return the minimum number of steps to spell all the characters in the keyword. Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at the ""12:00"" direction. You should spell all the characters in key one by one by rotating ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at the ""12:00"" direction and then by pressing the center button. At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:  You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as one step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of ring's characters at the ""12:00"" direction, where this character must equal key[i]. If the character key[i] has been aligned at the ""12:00"" direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as one step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage).

"A magical string s consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:  The string s is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string s itself.

If we group the consecutive 1's and 2's in s, it will be ""1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......"" and the occurrences of 1's or 2's in each group are ""1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......"".

"One way to serialize a binary tree is to use preorder traversal. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as '#'.

Given a string of comma-separated values preorder, return true if it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree. It is guaranteed that each comma-separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character '#' representing null pointer. You may assume that the input format is always valid.

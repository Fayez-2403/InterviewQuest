"Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. Implement the LRUCache class:  LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity. int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1. void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.  The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.  ",lru-cache,LRU Cache,Linked List,117
"Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.  ",two-sum,Two Sum,Hash Table,117
"Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.  ",number-of-islands,Number of Islands,Array,103
"Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.  ",merge-intervals,Merge Intervals,String,87
You are given an array of strings products and a string searchWord. Design a system that suggests at most three product names from products after each character of searchWord is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products. Return a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of searchWord is typed.  ,search-suggestions-system,Search Suggestions System,Depth-First Search,68
"You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.  ",best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock,Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock,Breadth-First Search,56
"Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.  ",group-anagrams,Group Anagrams,Backtracking,51
"Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0). The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., √(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2). You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).  ",k-closest-points-to-origin,K Closest Points to Origin,Array,49
"Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.  ",longest-substring-without-repeating-characters,Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters,Dynamic Programming,49
"You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.  ",merge-k-sorted-lists,Merge k Sorted Lists,String,47
